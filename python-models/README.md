# Python Models

The python models perfectly replicate the mathematical operations of the burn model. This means that it is possible to train a model end-to-end with the encoder to optimize performance.


Once the model has finished training, the weights can be extracted and imported into the rust runtime. Model weights from python frameworks will produce identical outputs in rust.
