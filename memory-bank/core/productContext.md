# Soma Product Context

## Product Vision
Soma is a decentralized network that harnesses machine curiosity to deepen our collective understanding of reality. It creates an ecosystem where knowledge can evolve, combine, and improve automatically.

The core of Soma is an incentive system that trains a massive, collaborative neural network by rewarding data that helps it learn. The goal is a system that evolves through the collective effort of its contributors.
