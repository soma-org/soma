# Product Context

## Purpose and Scope
This document explains why the Soma blockchain exists, the problems it solves, and the user experience goals for data contributors and consumers. It provides essential context for understanding the project's purpose, target users, and value proposition.

## Soma Mission
Soma transforms the growth of knowledge into a natural process by creating an incentive system for valuable knowledge contributions. The system objectively evaluates contributions through probe models and rewards the most valuable additions to our collective understanding, building a self-improving world model without central control.

## Problem Statement
Current approaches to building large language models (LLMs) and knowledge systems suffer from several limitations:

1. **Evaluation Challenges**: Difficulty in objectively assessing data quality and usefulness
2. **Data Freshness**: Models become outdated as knowledge evolves
3. **Knowledge Gaps**: Important domains remain under-represented in training data

## Solution Approach
Soma addresses these challenges through a decentralized blockchain-based system that:

1. **Distributes Evaluation**: Uses encoder shards to independently evaluate data usefulness
2. **Aligns Incentives**: Rewards data contributors based on the assessed value of their contributions and encoders on the quality of their representations
3. **Ensures Transparency**: Provides blockchain-based provenance and accounting
4. **Enables Self-Governance**: Allows the system to evolve through validator committee
5. **Promotes Diversity**: Encourages contributions across all knowledge domains
6. **Maintains Freshness**: Continuously incorporates new data and knowledge

## Key Stakeholders
