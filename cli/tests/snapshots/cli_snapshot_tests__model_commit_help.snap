Commit a new model (phase 1 of commit-reveal)

Registers a new model by committing its weight hashes. The model enters "pending" state and must be revealed in the next epoch or the stake is slashed.

Usage: soma model commit [OPTIONS] --model-id <MODEL_ID> --weights-url-commitment <WEIGHTS_URL_COMMITMENT> --weights-commitment <WEIGHTS_COMMITMENT> --architecture-version <ARCHITECTURE_VERSION> --stake-amount <STAKE_AMOUNT> --staking-pool-id <STAKING_POOL_ID>

Options:
      --model-id <MODEL_ID>
          Pre-assigned model ID (ObjectID)

      --weights-url-commitment <WEIGHTS_URL_COMMITMENT>
          Hex-encoded commitment to the encrypted weights URL (32 bytes)

      --weights-commitment <WEIGHTS_COMMITMENT>
          Hex-encoded commitment to the decrypted model weights (32 bytes)

      --architecture-version <ARCHITECTURE_VERSION>
          Model architecture version

      --stake-amount <STAKE_AMOUNT>
          Amount of SOMA to stake (in shannons)

      --commission-rate <COMMISSION_RATE>
          Commission rate in basis points (100 = 1%, max 10000 = 100%)
          
          [default: 0]

      --staking-pool-id <STAKING_POOL_ID>
          Staking pool ID (ObjectID, generated by caller)

      --tx-digest
          Compute the transaction digest and print it out, but do not execute

      --simulate
          Perform a dry run (simulation) of the transaction, without executing it

      --json
          

      --serialize-unsigned-transaction
          Serialize the unsigned transaction data (base64) instead of executing. Use with `soma client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes <TX_BYTES>`

      --serialize-signed-transaction
          Serialize the signed transaction data (base64) instead of executing. Use with `soma client execute-combined-signed-tx --signed-tx-bytes <SIGNED_TX_BYTES>`

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
