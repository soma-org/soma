Commit a new model (phase 1 of commit-reveal)

Registers a new model by committing its weight hashes. The model enters "pending" state and must be revealed in the next epoch or the stake is slashed.

Model ID and staking pool ID are auto-generated. Commitments are auto-computed from the weights file and URL.

Usage: soma model commit [OPTIONS] --weights-file <WEIGHTS_FILE> --weights-url <WEIGHTS_URL>

Options:
      --weights-file <WEIGHTS_FILE>
          Path to the encrypted weights file

      --weights-url <WEIGHTS_URL>
          URL where the encrypted weights are (or will be) hosted

      --architecture-version <ARCHITECTURE_VERSION>
          Model architecture version (auto-fetched from chain if omitted)

      --stake-amount <STAKE_AMOUNT>
          Amount of SOMA to stake (auto-fetches minimum from chain if omitted)

      --commission-rate <COMMISSION_RATE>
          Commission rate in basis points (100 = 1%, max 10000 = 100%)
          
          [default: 0]

      --tx-digest
          Compute the transaction digest and print it out, but do not execute

      --simulate
          Perform a dry run (simulation) of the transaction, without executing it

      --serialize-unsigned-transaction
          Serialize the unsigned transaction data (base64) instead of executing. Use with `soma tx execute-signed --tx-bytes <TX_BYTES>`

      --serialize-signed-transaction
          Serialize the signed transaction data (base64) instead of executing. Use with `soma tx execute-combined-signed --signed-tx-bytes <SIGNED_TX_BYTES>`

      --json
          Output as JSON

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

EXAMPLES:
    soma model commit --weights-url https://storage.example.com/weights.bin \
        --weights-file ./model.bin --commission-rate 500
